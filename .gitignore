# ICME Deep Learning Workshop
This repository hosts the ipython notebooks used for the Deep Learning workshop hosted by the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering at Stanford University

## Instructions and installation
Running the notebooks requires a working installation of python 2.7 with tensorflow and jupyter notebooks installed.

The easiest way to install the dependencies is to get the anaconda distribution of python from [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
